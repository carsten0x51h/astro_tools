astro_tools
===========

Helpful astronomy tools.


The idea of astro_tools came up when certain tasks during my
astrophotography sessions came up again and again. Since I am using
Linux, the support for certain tools was not yet as good as for windows.
One thing which was especially interesting was a tool that automatically
finds the best focus position of the camera plugged to the telescope.
Furthermore I wanted to have a kind of sequencer where I can script the
different tasks which are to be done during the night. I liked the idea
of having an automatic re-focusing from time to time - for example
between each frame or when the temperature has changed significantly.
In addition, certain actions should also be available via a commandline
interface.
Later I plan do add a Qt and/or web based GUI for this program.
To control the astronomical devices I use the INDI library.
For image processing I use CCfits and CIMG.
